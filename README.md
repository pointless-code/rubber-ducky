## About RubberDucky

A Docker container featuring digital rubber duck, adding a touch of whimsy to debugging and problem-solving in development.

## Origin of Rubber Duck Debugging

The origin of the term "rubber duck debugging" can be traced back to the book "The Pragmatic Programmer" by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas, published in 1999. In a section titled "The Power of Rubber Ducking," the authors suggest the practice of explaining code line-by-line to a rubber duck as a means of debugging.

The story goes that a programmer named Greg, working at a company where he was the only developer, would encounter bugs that he couldn't seem to solve. Frustrated, he began explaining his code to a nearby rubber duck. In the process of articulating the problem out loud, Greg often found the solution without needing any further assistance.

The effectiveness of this method spread through word of mouth and became known as "rubber duck debugging." Since then, it has become a widely recognized technique used by developers around the world to troubleshoot their code more effectively.
